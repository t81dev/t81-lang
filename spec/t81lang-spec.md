# T81Lang Specification

Version 0.2 — Draft (Standards Track)

Status: Draft → Standards Track\
Applies to: TISC, T81VM, Axion, Data Types

T81Lang is the **high-level, deterministic, ternary-native programming language** of the T81 Ecosystem.\
It compiles **exclusively** to TISC and guarantees predictable semantics under T81VM.

This document defines:

- language syntax and grammar
- deterministic semantics
- type system and canonical rules
- purity, effects, and safety
- compilation pipeline
- Axion visibility and tier interactions

______________________________________________________________________

## 0. Language Properties

T81Lang is designed with the following properties:

1. **Deterministic**\
   Every expression has a single, unambiguous meaning. No hidden I/O, nondeterminism, or environment leakage.

2. **Pure-by-default**\
   Functions are pure unless explicitly marked as effectful.

3. **Ternary-native semantics**\
   All numbers, fractions, logical values, and composite structures follow the T81 Data Types specification.

4. **Statically typed + Canonical**\
   All values must be canonical at every boundary; compile-time enforcement where possible.

5. **VM-compatible**\
   All generated TISC MUST:

   - be type-correct
   - be shape-correct
   - respect determinism and Axion policies

6. **Tier-aware**\
   Code MAY declare cognitive-tier intent, enabling Axion to enforce or monitor complexity bounds.

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Core Grammar

A simplified normative grammar follows.\
(Full formal grammar appears in Appendix A.)

```ebnf
program       ::= { function | declaration }*

function      ::= "fn" identifier "(" parameters ")" "->" type block
parameters    ::= [ parameter { "," parameter } ]
parameter     ::= identifier ":" type

block         ::= "{" statement* "}"

statement     ::= let_decl
                | var_decl
                | assign
                | return
                | if_stmt
                | loop_stmt
                | expr ";"

let_decl      ::= "let" identifier [ ":" type ] "=" expr ";"
var_decl      ::= "var" identifier [ ":" type ] [ "=" expr ] ";"
assign        ::= identifier "=" expr ";"
return        ::= "return" expr ";"

if_stmt       ::= "if" expr block [ "else" block ]
loop_stmt     ::= "loop" block

expr             ::= logical_or_expr
logical_or_expr  ::= logical_and_expr { "||" logical_and_expr }
logical_and_expr ::= equality_expr { "&&" equality_expr }
equality_expr    ::= relational_expr { ("==" | "!=") relational_expr }
relational_expr  ::= additive_expr { ("<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=") additive_expr }
additive_expr    ::= term { ("+" | "-") term }
term             ::= factor { ("*" | "/" | "%") factor }
factor        ::= literal
                | identifier
                | fn_call
                | unary_op factor
                | paren_expr

fn_call       ::= identifier "(" [ expr { "," expr } ] ")"

literal       ::= integer | float | fraction | symbol | vector_literal
vector_literal ::= "[" [ expr { "," expr } ] "]"

paren_expr    ::= "(" expr ")"
```

This grammar MUST be parsed deterministically.
No ambiguous operator precedence is allowed; all precedence rules are normative and listed in Appendix A.1.

### Vector Literal Typing Rules

- All elements in a vector literal MUST be of the same type, or be promotable to a common type according to the Numeric Widening rules.
- The type of an empty vector literal (`[]`) is inferred from its context. If the context does not provide a type, the program is ill-formed.

### Vector Literal Semantics

- Vector literals are immutable.
- Vector literals are value-type constructs. When passed to a function, they are passed by value (i.e., a copy is made).

Logical conjunction/disjunction use canonical ternary booleans: `0t81`
represents false, any non-zero `T81Int` represents true, and the emitted code
MUST short-circuit left-to-right. When the left operand of `&&` evaluates to
false or the left operand of `||` evaluates to true, the right operand MUST NOT
be evaluated. The final result MUST be `0t81` or `1t81`.

Division (`/`) follows the canonical semantics defined for the operand type in
[`tisc-spec.md`](tisc-spec.md#52-arithmetic-instructions) and deterministically
faults on a zero divisor. The modulo operator (`%`) is defined only for
`T81Int`; attempting to use `%` with any other type MUST be rejected at compile
time.

______________________________________________________________________

## 2. Type System

The T81Lang type system directly corresponds to the T81 Data Types spec.

### 2.1 Generic Type Syntax (Authoritative)

The **only** authoritative syntax for generic instantiation is square brackets:

```t81
Vector[T]
Map[Key, Value]
Option[T]
Result[Ok, Err]
Tensor[T, Rank]
Tensor[T, M, N]        # fixed-rank tensor with compile-time dimensions
```

Angle brackets `<...>` are **legacy** and must not appear in any new code or grammar.
The C++20 compiler frontend actively rejects this syntax to enforce the modern style.
All examples in the spec using `<...>` are hereby declared obsolete.

- Generic parameters are separated by commas when more than one is required.
- The first parameter is always the element type.
- Subsequent parameters, if present, are **compile-time constants** (not types).
- Tensor[T, 5, 10] is valid and denotes a fixed 5×10 tensor of T.
- Tensor[T, Rank] where Rank is a type-level integer remains supported for dynamic-rank tensors.

### 2.2 Primitive Types

- `T81Int`
- `T81Float`
- `T81Fraction`
- `Symbol`

These map 1:1 to the Data Types primitive categories.

### 2.3 Vector Type

- `Vector[T]`

The `Vector[T]` type is syntactic sugar for a rank-1 `Tensor` of type `T`. All operations on `Vector[T]` are equivalent to operations on a rank-1 `Tensor`.

### 2.4 Composite Types

- `Matrix[T]`
- `Tensor[T, Rank]`
- `Record { ... }`
- `Enum { ... }`

Composite types MUST:

- have static shapes where applicable (vectors, matrices, tensors)
- follow canonicalization rules when constructed

### 2.5 Structural Types Option[T] and Result[T, E]

These are **first-class core types** and MUST be present in the grammar.
They use exactly the same square-bracket syntax as user generics.
No legacy equivalents exist; they are new additions that have no backwards-compatibility burden.

`Option[T]` exposes two constructors:

- `Some(expr)` wraps a value of type `T`. When no contextual type exists, the
  compiler infers `Option[T]` directly from the operand.
- `None` represents the absence of a value and therefore REQUIRES a contextual
  `Option[T]` (e.g., a variable declaration or function parameter) so the
  compiler can verify downstream uses.

`Result[T, E]` provides explicit success/failure constructors:

- `Ok(expr)` yields the success branch (`T`) and MUST appear in a context that
  already specifies `Result[T, E]`.
- `Err(expr)` yields the error branch (`E`) under the same contextual-type
  requirement.

Both structural types lower to canonical handles backed by the VM. Handles are
deduplicated so equality comparisons operate on semantic contents rather than
allocation identity.

### 2.4 Canonicalization Rules

All values MUST be canonical at:

- construction
- mutation
- function return
- VM boundary crossing

If a value is non-canonical, the compiler MUST either:

- normalize it at compile time, or
- emit code that performs canonicalization at runtime, or
- reject the program with a type error

### 2.5 Numeric Widening

`T81Int` values MAY be widened to `T81Float` or `T81Fraction` whenever a context
requires the wider type (e.g., declarations, parameter passing, binary
arithmetic, or comparisons). Widening MUST be performed by inserting the
appropriate conversion opcodes:

- `I2F` for `T81Int → T81Float`
- `I2FRAC` for `T81Int → T81Fraction`

No other implicit conversions are permitted. In particular, the compiler MUST
NOT automatically convert floats or fractions back to integers; such narrowing
would need explicit syntax in a future revision.

______________________________________________________________________

## 3. Purity and Effects

### 3.1 Pure Functions

A function is pure if:

- it reads no global or external state
- it performs no I/O
- its result depends only on its parameters
- it produces no VM-visible side effects except deterministic computation

Pure functions MAY be optimized aggressively.

### 3.2 Effectful Functions

Marked with:

```t81
@effect
fn write_log(x: T81Int) -> Unit { ... }
```

Effectful operations include:

- memory mutation
- VM I/O channels (to be defined)
- Axion interactions
- tensor heavy ops (if declared impure via cost annotations)

### 3.3 Tiered Purity

Optional annotation:

```t81
@tier(2)
```

This indicates cognitive-tier complexity expectations and allows Axion to regulate recursion and resource scaling.

______________________________________________________________________

## 4. Name Resolution

T81Lang uses lexical scoping.
Name resolution is deterministic:

1. Look up in local scope
2. Look up in parent scopes
3. Look up in module scope
4. Resolve via imports (imports MUST be explicit and acyclic)

Shadowing is allowed but MUST be resolved deterministically by nearest scope.

______________________________________________________________________

## 5. Compilation Pipeline

Compilation to TISC follows **eight deterministic stages**.

### Stage 1 — Lexing

Produces a canonical stream of tokens.

### Stage 2 — Parsing

Produces an AST conforming to the grammar.

### Stage 3 — Semantic Analysis & Type Checking

This stage is responsible for verifying the semantic correctness of the program. The initial pass, which is now implemented, performs **name resolution** and **scope analysis**. The next development priority is to extend this pass to perform full **type checking**.

The complete type checker **MUST** enforce the following guarantees:

- **No Type Mismatches:** All expressions and statements must adhere to the type system.
- **Valid Shapes:** All tensor and vector operations must use compatible shapes.
- **Canonical Forms:** All constructed values must be in their canonical form.
- **Arithmetic Correctness:**
  - Arithmetic expressions are only legal when both operands share a primitive type and TISC exposes a matching opcode (`ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/MOD` for `T81Int`, `FADD/FSUB/FMUL/FDIV` for `T81Float`, `FRACADD/FRACSUB/FRACMUL/FRACDIV` for `T81Fraction`).
  - When an expression mixes `T81Int` with either `T81Float` or `T81Fraction`, the compiler MUST insert a deterministic widening conversion (`I2F` or `I2FRAC`) so the operands share the non-integer type before lowering.
  - Any other mixed-type arithmetic MUST be rejected.
  - The modulo operator (`%`) is legal **only** when both operands are `T81Int`.
  - Division by zero MUST surface the VM’s deterministic `DivideByZero` fault.
- **Literal Typing:** Literal expressions for `T81Float`, `T81Fraction`, and `Symbol` MUST be tagged with their declared types.
- **Comparison Correctness:**
  - Comparison expressions (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) MUST return a `T81Int` (as a canonical boolean).
  - Operands MUST share the same primitive numeric type, with the same widening rules as arithmetic.
  - `Symbol` operands are legal ONLY for equality/inequality.
- **Assignment and Function Call Correctness:**
  - When storing into variables, passing call arguments, or returning from a function, `T81Int` values MAY be widened to `T81Float` or `T81Fraction`.
  - Narrowing conversions (e.g., float to integer) MUST NOT be inserted implicitly.
- **Logical Operations:** Logical conjunction/disjunction (`&&`, `||`) MUST evaluate operands left-to-right, short-circuit deterministically, and operate on canonical boolean `T81Int` values.
- **Structural Type Correctness (`Option`/`Result`):**
  - `Some(expr)` infers `Option[T]` from `expr`'s type `T` or matches a contextual `Option` type.
  - `None` has no payload and therefore REQUIRES a contextual `Option[T]` type.
  - `Ok(expr)` and `Err(expr)` also require a contextual `Result[T, E]` type to check the payload against the correct branch.

A single example can illustrate many of these rules in practice:
```t81
// A function that returns an Option type
fn find_positive(val: T81Int) -> Option[T81Int] {
    if (val > 0) {
        return Some(val);
    } else {
        return None;
    }
}

// A variable declaration with an explicit type
let my_value: T81Int = -5;

// Using a match expression to safely unwrap the Option
let result_text: Symbol = match (find_positive(my_value)) {
    Some(v) => `Found positive value`,
    None    => `Value was not positive`,
};
```

### Vector & Matrix Operations Example

```t81
fn process_vectors(a: Vector[T81Int], b: Vector[T81Int]) -> T81Int {
    // Vectors support element-wise operations if they have compatible shapes
    let sum = a + b;

    // Dot product of two vectors
    return contract(a, b);
}

fn matrix_transform(m: Matrix[T81Float], v: Vector[T81Float]) -> Vector[T81Float] {
    // Matrix multiplication
    return m * v;
}
```

### Generic Type Example

```t81
// A generic container for any T81 type
record Box[T] {
    content: T,
}

fn open_box[T](b: Box[T]) -> T {
    return b.content;
}

let int_box: Box[T81Int] = Box { content: 42 };
let value: T81Int = open_box(int_box);
```

### Record and Enum Example

```t81
record Point {
    x: T81Int,
    y: T81Int,
}

enum Shape {
    Circle(T81Int),         // Circle with radius
    Rectangle(Point, Point), // Rectangle with top-left and bottom-right points
}

fn area_squared(s: Shape) -> T81Int {
    return match (s) {
        Circle(r) => 3 * r * r,
        Rectangle(p1, p2) => (p2.x - p1.x) * (p2.y - p1.y),
    };
}
```

### Loop and Boundedness Example

```t81
fn factorial(n: T81Int) -> T81Int {
    var result: T81Int = 1;
    var i: T81Int = n;

    @bounded(100) // Expect this loop to run at most 100 times
    loop {
        if (i <= 1) {
            return result;
        }
        result = result * i;
        i = i - 1;
    }
}
```

### Safety Limit Examples

T81Lang code is subject to Axion safety policies. The following examples
illustrate code patterns that may trigger deterministic Axion traps if policy
limits are exceeded.

#### Recursion Depth Limit

Deep recursion triggers a `SecurityFault` when the stack depth exceeds the
`(max-recursion <n>)` policy limit.

```t81
// This will trap if max-recursion is set to a small value (e.g., 10)
fn deep_recursion(n: T81Int) -> T81Int {
    if (n <= 0) { return 0; }
    return 1 + deep_recursion(n - 1);
}
```

#### Instruction Count Limit

Infinite or extremely long loops trigger a `SecurityFault` when the total
executed instruction count exceeds the `(max-instructions <n>)` limit.

```t81
fn infinite_loop() {
    @bounded(infinite)
    loop {
        // performs work indefinitely until Axion veto
    }
}
```

#### Stack Usage Limit

Large local variable allocations trigger a `StackFault` (if exceeding physical
segment) or `SecurityFault` (if exceeding `(max-stack <n>)` policy).

```t81
fn large_stack_usage() {
    // This may trigger a StackFault depending on VM configuration
    // and Axion max-stack policy.
    let data: Vector[T81Int] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    // ... complex local state ...
}
```

### Effectful Function Example

```t81
@effect
fn log_and_calculate(x: T81Int) -> T81Int {
    // Calling an intrinsic effectful function for logging
    write_axion_log(`Calculating for value`, x);

    return x * x;
}
```

### Stage 4 — Purity Analysis

Tracks pure vs impure operations.

### Stage 5 — Control Flow Normalization

All loops become structured CFG nodes; early exits are normalized into explicit jumps.

### Stage 6 — Intermediate Representation (IR)

The IR is ternary-native, SSA-like, and preserves canonical form.
Each IR instruction has:

- deterministic semantics
- no implicit side effects
- clear type consistency

### Stage 7 — TISC Lowering

Maps IR instructions to TISC sequences:

| IR Construct | TISC Output |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `a + b` (`T81Int`) | `LOADI`, `ADD` sequence |
| `a * b` (`T81Int`) | `MUL` |
| `a + b` (`T81Float`) | literal handle load, `FADD` |
| `a * b` (`T81Float`) | `FMUL` |
| `a + b` (`T81Fraction`) | literal handle load, `FRACADD` |
| `a * b` (`T81Fraction`) | `FRACMUL` |
| `a / b` (`T81Int`) | `DIV` (faults on zero divisor) |
| `a % b` (`T81Int`) | `MOD` (faults on zero divisor) |
| `a / b` (`T81Float`) | `FDIV` (faults on zero divisor) |
| `a / b` (`T81Fraction`) | `FRACDIV` (faults on zero divisor) |
| comparisons (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) | `CMP`, `SETF`, literal/branch sequence producing a `T81Int` (`Symbol` allowed only for `==`/`!=`) |
| `T81Int → T81Float/T81Fraction` promotion | `I2F` / `I2FRAC` emitted before the consuming opcode/assignment |
| `Some(expr)` | Evaluate `expr`, `MAKE_OPTION_SOME` to produce canonical handle |
| `None` | Contextual type chooses `Option[T]`, emit `MAKE_OPTION_NONE` |
| `vector literal` | Evaluate elements, construct a rank-1 `T729Tensor`, add to `tensor_pool`, and load handle with `LoadImm`. |
| `Ok(expr)` | Evaluate `expr`, `MAKE_RESULT_OK` |
| `Err(expr)` | Evaluate `expr`, `MAKE_RESULT_ERR` |
| `match (value)` over `Option/Result` | Evaluate subject once, use `OPTION_IS_SOME` / `RESULT_IS_OK` plus conditional jumps; bind payloads via `OPTION_UNWRAP` or `RESULT_UNWRAP_OK` / `RESULT_UNWRAP_ERR` before lowering the selected arm |
| logical `a && b` | Evaluate `a`, `JumpIfZero` to skip RHS, evaluate `b` only when needed, write `0t81/1t81` deterministically |
| logical `a || b` | Evaluate `a`, `JumpIfNotZero` to skip RHS, evaluate `b` only when needed, write `0t81/1t81` deterministically |
| vector add | `TVECADD` |
| matrix mul | `TMATMUL` |
| fn call | `CALL`, argument push, return capture |
| recursion | same as fn call; Axion receives call depth |

Lowering MUST also emit float/fraction/symbol literals into their respective
program pools before they are referenced by any instruction, and all references
in registers MUST be 1-based handles into those pools.
Comparisons first emit `CMP`/`SETF` to obtain the sign of the subtraction in a
register, then use deterministic branch sequences to write `0` or `1` back into
a `T81Int` destination register so higher-level control flow can reuse the
result.

The lowering pass MUST NOT introduce nondeterminism.

### Stage 8 — Code Generation

Produces:

- TISC binary
- metadata section (tier hints, purity map, shape map)
- Axion inspection records (optional but recommended)

______________________________________________________________________

## 6. Control Flow Semantics

All control flow is explicit and deterministic.

### 6.1 If/Else

- Condition MUST be a canonical boolean encoded as T81Int (0, 1, or -1 via ternary truth table).
- Branch lowering MUST produce deterministic TISC control flow.

### 6.2 Match

T81Lang exposes `match` expressions for structural types:

```t81
let total: T81Int = match (maybe_value) {
  Some(v) => v + 1t81,
  None => 0t81,
};
```

- The scrutinee inside `match ( … )` is evaluated exactly once.
- For `Option[T]` the arms MUST include exactly one `Some(binding)` arm and one
  `None` arm (order-insensitive). `binding` introduces a new immutable variable
  scoped to that arm; use `_` to ignore the payload.
- For `Result[T, E]` the arms MUST include exactly one `Ok(binding)` and one
  `Err(binding)` arm.
- Each arm MUST evaluate to the same type; the first arm determines the result
  type if no contextual type is provided.
- Lowering MUST branch via `OPTION_IS_SOME` / `RESULT_IS_OK`, use the matching
  `OPTION_UNWRAP` or `RESULT_UNWRAP_*` opcode when a payload binding is present,
  and jump over the inactive arm so that only the selected expression executes.
- Missing arms, duplicate variants, or mismatched types are compile-time errors.

### 6.3 Loop

Loops MUST:

- have deterministic entry/exit
- expose recursion depth and loop iteration counts to Axion
- be transformable into static CFG structures

Infinite loops are allowed *only* if annotated:

```t81
@bounded(infinite)
loop { ... }
```

Otherwise, an unbounded loop without explicit annotation is a compile-time error.

### 6.4 Recursion

Recursion is allowed but MUST:

- have explicit tier annotations if deep recursion is possible
- provide a deterministic termination guarantee if pure and finite

______________________________________________________________________

## 7. Axion Integration

Axion observes T81Lang at:

- compilation boundaries
- function entry/exit
- recursion depth
- effectful operations
- tensor heavy ops
- purity violations
- memory model constraints

### 7.1 Tier Metadata

Compilation emits tier metadata:

```text
tier-hints:
  function foo: tier 1
  function bar: tier 3
  function baz: tier 2 (recursive)
```

Axion MAY:

- veto unsafe recursion
- restructure execution scheduling
- enforce safety boundaries

### 7.2 Safety Hooks

All unsafe or effectful constructs compile to TISC sequences that call Axion hooks via:

- AXREAD
- AXSET
- AXVERIFY

before or after execution as required by Axion policy.

______________________________________________________________________

## 8. Interoperability Summary

T81Lang MUST:

- use [Data Types](t81-data-types.md) exactly
- lower to [TISC](tisc-spec.md) deterministically
- rely on [T81VM](t81vm-spec.md) for memory and execution
- inform and be regulated by [Axion](axion-kernel.md)
- enable structured reasoning for [Cognitive Tiers](cognitive-tiers.md)
